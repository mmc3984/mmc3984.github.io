## Matt Colton

Hi! I'm Matt Colton, a freshman Software Engineering major at RIT, and this is my GitHub Pages site!

#### Rundown

I'm from Fairport, NY, a suburb not far from RIT, and attended McQuaid Jesuit High School. During my time there, my big 'thing' was the robotics team, ours being IgKnighters Team 3173. Robotics played a large part in my interest in programming in an engineering setting, and is a large part of why I'm excited to work on bigger projects in my future.

#### Favorite Food

I'm one of the very few people in the United States that likes pizza!
